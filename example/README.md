# Signal Protocol Examples

This directory contains basic examples for using the Signal Protocol library.

## üìÅ Examples

### Basic Dart Example
- **File**: [`dart_example.dart`](dart_example.dart)
- **Description**: Basic FFI usage example showing identity generation and prekey bundles
- **Usage**: `dart run dart_example.dart`

### Complete Flutter Application
- **Location**: [`../flutter_signal_chat/`](../flutter_signal_chat/)
- **Description**: Full-featured Flutter group chat application with Signal Protocol
- **Features**: Complete X3DH, Double Ratchet, group messaging, and UI implementation

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Basic Usage
```bash
# Run the basic Dart example
dart run example/dart_example.dart
```

### For Complete Implementation
```bash
# Explore the full Flutter application
cd flutter_signal_chat
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## üìö Documentation

- **[Dart Binding Guide](../docs/DART_BINDING_GUIDE.md)** - Complete integration guide
- **[Dart API Reference](../docs/DART_API_REFERENCE.md)** - Detailed Dart binding API documentation
- **[Flutter Example](../flutter_signal_chat/README.md)** - Complete application documentation

## üîÑ Migration Path

If you're using the basic example and want to upgrade to the full implementation:

1. **Review** the [Flutter example](../flutter_signal_chat/) for complete functionality
2. **Follow** the [Dart Binding Guide](../docs/DART_BINDING_GUIDE.md) for integration
3. **Reference** the [Dart API documentation](../docs/DART_API_REFERENCE.md) for all available functions

The basic example here is maintained for educational purposes, but the Flutter application provides a production-ready implementation with all Signal Protocol features.
